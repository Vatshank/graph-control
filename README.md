Controllability of networks

[random_powerlaw.py](https://github.com/Vatshank/graph-control/blob/master/random_powerlaw.py) reproduces the results in [this](http://www.barabasilab.com/pubs/CCNR-ALB_Publications/201105-12_Nature-TamingComplexity/201105-12_Nature-TamingComplexity.pdf) paper on Controllability of Complex Networks (Yang-Yu Liu, Jean-Jacques Slotine & Albert-Laszlo Barabasi). More specifically Figure 3 where the authors investigate the impact of network structure on the number of driver nodes.

[aks.py](https://github.com/Vatshank/graph-control/blob/master/aks.py) implements the fast matching algorithm as described [here] (http://arxiv.org/pdf/1503.08019.pdf) - Optimality of Fast Matching Algorithms for Random Networks with Applications to Structural Controllability (Mohamad Kazem Shirani Faradonbeh, Ambuj Tewari, and George Michailidis).
